				<p>Ever since I moved to Belgium, software development has been something that I admire. I still remember when my best friend show me he was learning JavaScript and, from that moment, I was amazed. 
					For me, coding is having the ability to create great and wonderful things out of the blue.</p>
				<p>
					Then, at college, I had the idea of ​​creating an app that would allow me to study in a faster and more efficient way. However, it was very expensive to hire someone who could create it, and I didn't know how to do it myself. This is why I wanted to learn how to code, but it was difficult for me to learn on my own. This year I met Henry and I had the opportunity to be selected to participate and learn from this bootcamp. 
					And it was here that I learned truly how much there was to learn and how creative someone has to be in order to become in a software developer.</p>
				<p>Thanks to that, I am Full-stack Web Developer certified in HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Bootstrap, Node.js, Sequelize ORM, Express.js & PostgreSQL. Focused and passionate in Front-end development. I am still enthusiastic grabbing onto other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head. </p>
